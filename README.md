# Analysing SpaceX Falcon 9 Landings
### Project Background and Context
Objective: Predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.

- SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches for 62 million dollars, while other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars.
- Much of the cost savings are due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket.
- Predicting the landing success of the first stage can help determine the cost of a launch.
- This information can be valuable for alternate companies looking to bid against SpaceX for rocket launches.
